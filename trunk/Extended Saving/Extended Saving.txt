Extended Saving v0.9 by Baltram <baltram-lielb@web.de> (June 21th 2014)
------

Extended Saving is a collection of macro scripts and callbacks in the MAXScript language
that extend GMax's file saving process and allow the import of .3db files.

If Extended Saving is enabled while a .gmax file is being saved, certain additional data
is appended to the file which makes it possible for other programs (like Rimy3D) to 
import that file.

Installation:

  Open the file 'installExtendedSaving.gmax' in GMax.

Usage:

  Expand the 'Extended Saving' menu located in GMax's main menu bar. You can then

    ...enable/disable Extended Saving for the current .gmax file.
    ...enable/disable Extended Saving by default (this default setting is applied every
       time you create a new scene or do a reset).
    ...enable Extended Saving for once and trigger a file save.
    ...import a .3db file.
    ...uninstall Extended Saving
    ...retrieve basic information about your Extended Saving installation (e.g. version)

  by clicking on the respective menu items.
