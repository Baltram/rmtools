Extended Saving is a collection of macro scripts and callbacks in the MAXScript language that extend GMax's file 
saving process and allow the import of .3db files.

Installation:
  Open the file "installExtendedSaving.gmax" with GMax.

Usage:
  Click on the menu named "Extended Saving" in the main GMax menu bar. You can then...
  ...enable/disable Extended Saving for the current .gmax file.
  ...enable/disable Extended Saving by default (this is applied every time you create a new scene or do a reset).
  ...enable Extended Saving for once and trigger a file save.
  ...import a .3db file.
